# ObsPy Tutorial

I used 24th of October 2016 Amatrice and 16th of July 2011 Alaska earthquakes to do this tutorial. Waveform are provided by SeisRaM working group and IRIS, respectively.

Explanation of tutorials are as below:

Earthquake Detection - Examples of two different STA/LTA triggering methods

Filtering - Examples of lowpass, highpass and bandpass filters on data

Fourier Transform - Calculating and plotting of fast fourier transforms of data

Integration and Differentiation - Integration and differentiation of waveform to move through acceleration to displacement

Numpy for Earthquake - Examples of capturing a portion of the data, plotting and identification of peak values amplitude and position

Read and Trim - Reading and trimming the waveform

Remove Response - Removing insturement response of a station by using response files

Response Spectra - Calculation of spectral acceleration, velocity and displacement of a signal

Rotate Channels - Rotate East and North components to Radial and Transverse components

Saving to a csv file - Creating and saving a database that are created some features of the station and earthquake

Spectrogram - Plotting and saving the spectrogram of the waveform
